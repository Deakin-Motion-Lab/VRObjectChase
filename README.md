# VRObjectChase
Object chase and capture game in VR

Framework game developed in Unity for Amblyopia Project (https://github.com/cube-research-space/Amblyopia.git)

Random objects (Balls) spawn from four points (Holes) and follow a randomly selected path to another point until the game timer reaches zero.

Balls can interact (be caught) with a HTC Vive controller and a UI panel udpates to show current score and game time.

NOTE: Under development - to be implemented into Amblyopia Project
  - objects to become animated rabbits
  - objects to be viewable in either left / right / both VR cameras
  - moon landscape to be added
